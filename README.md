I graduated with 105/110 at Insubria University of Varese ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ with a thesis about the use of a LSTM neural model combined with a sentiment analysis to make stock movement predictions.
Working on the thesis I've used Python with:
- Numpy

I spent a year in Madrid ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ thank to Erasmus project to study in the Rey Juan Carlos University and learn spanish.
